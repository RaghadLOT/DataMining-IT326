Motivations:

Choosing to work on a Cardiovascular Disease (CVD) dataset is driven by the fact that CVD affects a lot of people globally, causing millions of deaths each year. Our project aims to understand the various factors contributing to CVD using different types of data. The goal is to help detect, prevent, and manage CVD better, fitting into the larger picture of using data to improve healthcare. Ultimately, our project wants to contribute to global efforts in public health by providing useful insights and solutions for dealing with cardiovascular diseases.
